# Writing the second over the first meant that merely RUNNING THE DEV SERVER from a git
# checkout silently modified a tracked file. `git add -A` then swept a 100KB reshuffle of
# minified CSS into the commit and ci/tailwind-fresh went red with a diff that explained
# nothing — on a PR whose real change touched no Tailwind classes at all. It also meant writing
# app state into the app directory, which is read-only in some deploys.

# The runtime sheet lives in CONFIG_DIR now. This route serves it when it exists and otherwise
# falls through to the committed one. It MUST be registered BEFORE the /static mount: routes
# are matched in order, and the mount would otherwise swallow the path.

    """The runtime sheet, but ONLY when it is actually the right answer.

    Codex [P2] on the first cut of #911, and it was right: a persisted sheet can outlive the
    reason it existed and then MASK newer core CSS indefinitely. Two ways:

      * THE USER REMOVED THEIR PLUGINS. Startup only rebuilds when there are user plugins, so
        nothing would ever overwrite the old sheet — and it still carries classes for plugins
        that are gone, while missing nothing. With no user plugins the COMMITTED sheet is by
        definition complete and authoritative.
      * THE APP WAS UPGRADED. A new release ships new core classes in static/tailwind.min.css.
        The runtime sheet on disk predates them. Serving it hides the new CSS until something
        happens to trigger a rebuild — which, if the toolchain is absent (no node), is never.

    Freshness is decided by CONTENT, not mtime. Codex [P2] again, and again correct: archives
    and container images routinely PRESERVE SOURCE MTIMES, so a just-shipped stylesheet can
    carry an older timestamp than a runtime sheet built days ago — and an mtime check would call
    the stale one fresh. tailwind_rebuild stamps each runtime build with the hash of the
    committed sheet it was made from; a core upgrade changes that file, hence that hash.

    Falling back to the committed sheet is always safe: at worst it lacks a just-installed
    plugin's classes for the seconds until the async rebuild lands.
