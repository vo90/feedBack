//
// ━━━ THIS WAS THE UNCUTTABLE HEART, AND IT IS 359 LINES ━━━
//
// At the start of the app.js carve, seeding a dependency closure from count-in, from loops, from
// section-practice or from the JUCE seek shim all returned the SAME 178-function, 3,360-line
// set. playSong and showScreen called each other; everything called them; nothing could be cut
// anywhere. The conclusion — correct at the time — was that no closure-based carve could touch
// it at any seed, and the answer was a HOST SEAM.
//
// That was true THEN. It is not true now. Every slice taken out since (transport, loops,
// count-in, section-practice, the library, the edit modal, settings) removed edges, and the
// strongly-connected component DISSOLVED. This closure is 36 declarations with an interface
// width of FOUR.
//
// The lesson is not that the seam was wrong. The seam is what MADE this possible: it let the
// carves proceed against a cyclic core instead of stalling on it. The lesson is to RE-MEASURE.
// An SCC is a fact about a graph at a moment, not a property of the code.
//
// ━━━ THE GATE STATEMENTS AT THE BOTTOM, AND WHY NO SCAN FOUND THEM ━━━
//
// window.feedBack.holdAutoplay / holdAutoExit and their two event handlers are TOP-LEVEL
// STATEMENTS, not declarations. They WRITE this module's state (_autoplayHeld, _autoExitTimer,
// …), and an imported binding is READ-ONLY — so left behind in app.js, every one of them threw
// "Assignment to constant variable" the instant this module existed.
//
// A dependency scan that walks DECLARATIONS cannot see them. Only the browser A/B did. It is the
// same blind spot that nearly shipped a dead library A-Z rail (#896): app.js keeps its public
// API in top-level statements, and those are invisible to a call-graph.
//
// ━━━ ZERO OUTSIDE WRITES, BY MOVING THE BOUNDARY RATHER THAN BUILDING MACHINERY ━━━
//
// Autoplay scalars and the wake-lock state were written from outside — which would have forced a
// setter or a container. But the writers (_releaseAutoplay, _acquireWakeLock) plainly belong
// here. Pulling them in left ZERO outside writes, so every export is a plain import. Same move as
// settings (#920): measure the writers before you reach for a container.

    //
    // The v3 shell replaced #home with #v3-songs. That mapping DID exist — but only inside
    // wrappers on `window.showScreen`, and only for callers that go through `window`:
    //
    //     app.js publishes the raw fn  ->  shell.js wraps it (adding the mapping)
    //                                  ->  the stems plugin wraps it AGAIN, capturing whatever
    //                                      happened to be there at the time
    //
    // Two ways that fails, and testers hit both:
    //
    //   1. ORDER. Three independent parties monkey-patch window.showScreen, each capturing the
    //      current value. Plugins load ASYNCHRONOUSLY, so the chain links up in whatever order
    //      the race settles — and any capture taken before shell.js installs, or any
    //      re-assignment after it, silently drops the mapping.
    //
    //   2. THE INTERNAL CALLERS NEVER TOUCHED window.showScreen AT ALL. closeCurrentSong and the
    //      Esc-from-settings shortcut call the IMPORTED showScreen directly, so no wrapper ever
    //      sees them. Verified in a browser: the unwrapped function with 'home' lands on the dead
    //      legacy screen every single time.
    //
    // Hence "randomly, when moving to the library from another menu option" — and "never when a
    // song ends", because closeCurrentSong resolves its target through _resolvePlayerOrigin(),
    // which already applies this mapping.
    //
    // So it lives HERE now: ONE guard in the function every caller routes through, rather than a
    // chain of monkey-patches that must each remember.
    //
    // ONLY 'home'. NOT 'v3-home'. _resolvePlayerOrigin() maps BOTH — correctly, because it
    // computes where to RETURN TO after a song, and coming back to the Songs list from the
    // dashboard is the right behaviour. Copying that condition here was a [P1] (Codex caught it):
    // #v3-home is the v3 DASHBOARD, a real screen the shell's Home nav, the onboarding tour and
    // the dashboard re-render listener all target. Redirecting it would make Home unreachable.
    //
    // A legacy alias is not the same thing as a return target.

    // ── screen:changing — emitted BEFORE any of the work below ──────────────────
    //
    // Timing matters here, and Codex caught me getting it wrong. The stems plugin used to
    // monkey-patch window.showScreen so it could tear down its audio graph BEFORE navigation
    // began. screen:changed fires at the very END of this function — after awaiting library and
    // provider loads — so moving that plugin onto it would have delayed teardown behind a slow
    // fetch, or skipped it entirely if the fetch threw. Stems would keep playing on a non-player
    // screen.
    //
    // So there are two events, and the distinction is the whole point:
    //     screen:changing  — before anything happens. "I am leaving `from`." Cancel/teardown here.
    //     screen:changed   — after the DOM and data are settled. "I am on `id`."
