"""The highway chart WebSocket — /ws/highway/{filename}.

The single largest handler in server.py, extracted to its own router (R3). Path
constants are read through the appstate seam (appstate.static_dir /
sloppak_cache_dir / audio_cache_dir / config_dir); the smart-arrangement /
author / offset helpers it exclusively uses move with it. Everything else is
nested inside the handler or imported from the shared lib modules. Logs through
the same `feedBack.server` logger name, so existing filters resolve unchanged.
