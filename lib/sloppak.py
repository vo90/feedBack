A `.sloppak` is an open, hand-editable song package. It exists in two

1. **Zip archive** — a `.sloppak` file containing a `manifest.yaml`,

2. **Directory** — a directory whose name ends in `.sloppak/` containing the
   same files. Authoring form.

    live, and this repo invented a top-level key pointing at a parallel
    `original/` directory (#583) to hold it. That key was never in the spec, and
    #933 removed our dependence on it: the mixdown is a stem.

    carries `original_audio: original/full.ogg` and would otherwise lose its full

    `tools/migrate_full_mix_stem.py` is the migration.
