    """Derive the active arrangement's string count.

    Used by the server to emit ``stringCount`` in the song_info
    WebSocket payload (feedBack-plugin-3dhighway#7).

    The arrangement XML schema always emits 6 ``<tuning>`` slots regardless
    of instrument (bass charts populate `string0`–`string3` and pad
    `string4`/`string5` with zeros), so ``len(arr.tuning)`` is not
    a reliable signal. Two independent signals get combined:

    1. **Notes-derived lower bound.** The highest string index
       referenced anywhere in notes + chord-notes, +1. A GP-imported
       7-string guitar with notes on strings 0..6 reports 7 here.
       But this is a LOWER BOUND only — a 6-string lead chart that
       never plays string 5 reports 5, undercounting by 1.

    2. **Instrument-type fallback.** An arrangement whose authoritative
       instrument signal says bass defaults to 4; everything else
       defaults to 6. This catches the partial-string-usage case where
       notes don't span all the instrument's strings. The bass signal is
       any of: an editor-authored ``type == "bass"`` (feedpak-spec §5.2 /
       editor PR #335 — lifted onto sloppaks by ``sloppak.load_song``),
       the ``path_bass`` <arrangementProperties> flag (archive/DLC
       sources), or the legacy "bass" case-insensitive substring in the
       name. Trusting ``type``/``path_bass`` closes the gap where a user
       authors a bass instrument on an arrangement whose NAME doesn't say
       "bass" (the editor lays out 4 lanes; core must agree).

    A third signal — ``len(arr.tuning)`` when it isn't the arrangement XML
    padded value of 6 — folds in for sloppak / GP-imported sources
    where the tuning array is explicitly trimmed (4 for bass, 5 for
    5-string bass, 7 for 7-string guitar, etc.). arrangement XML / archive
    sources always emit length 6 regardless of instrument, so we
    deliberately ignore that exact value to avoid mis-classifying
    bass arrangements as guitar. ``< 6`` and ``> 6`` are both
    trustworthy signals.

    The result is ``max(notes_count, name_based, tuning_count)``
    where ``tuning_count`` is ``len(arr.tuning)`` when ``!= 6``,
    else 0. Worked examples:

    * arrangement XML 4-string bass, full usage (tuning len 6, notes 0..3) →
      max(4, 4, 0) = 4
    * arrangement XML 4-string bass, sparse usage (tuning len 6, notes 0..2) →
      max(3, 4, 0) = 4
    * arrangement XML 6-string lead, full usage (tuning len 6, notes 0..5) →
      max(6, 6, 0) = 6
    * arrangement XML 6-string lead, sparse usage (tuning len 6, notes 0..4) →
      max(5, 6, 0) = 6
    * Sloppak 5-string bass, sparse usage (tuning len 5, notes 0..3) →
      max(4, 4, 5) = 5
    * GP 7-string guitar (tuning len 7, notes 0..6) → max(7, 6, 7) = 7
    * GP 5-string bass (tuning len 5, notes 0..4) → max(5, 4, 5) = 5
    * Empty arrangement named "Bass" (tuning len 6) →
      max(0, 4, 0) = 4
    * Empty arrangement named "Lead" (tuning len 6) →
      max(0, 6, 0) = 6
    * Editor-authored bass named "Low End" (type "bass", tuning len 6,
      notes 0..3) → name_based=4 → max(4, 4, 0) = 4
    * DLC bass named "Low End" (pathBass flag set, tuning len 6, notes
      0..3) → name_based=4 → max(4, 4, 0) = 4
