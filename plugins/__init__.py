    The encoding is **bijective** so distinct plugin_ids always map

        If so, flip its pending entry to "disabled" and report it so the loader
        skips the mount. Called both before install and again right before route
        setup so a disable that lands anywhere before mounting — including during

        The residual race is narrow and inherent: a disable arriving AFTER the

        semantics.

        Reads BOTH the persisted state and the in-memory pending flag: the
        toggle endpoint writes plugin_state.json BEFORE it flips the in-memory
        flag, so a disable can be on disk a hair before it is in memory.

    # ── Module-graph cache busting (#879) ────────────────────────────────
    #
    # ES modules are evaluated ONCE PER URL PER DOCUMENT. Re-inserting a
    # <script type="module"> whose src the module map has already seen fires
    # `load` but does NOT re-run the body. So re-loading a plugin — a rollback,
    # and (see below) an upgrade too — silently kept the OLD module live while
    # the loader recorded success: a no-op that reported it worked.
    #
    # Busting the ENTRY url does not help. A module plugin's screen.js is a
    # one-line `import './src/main.js'`, and a relative specifier resolves
    # against the base URL WITH THE QUERY DROPPED — so a ?v= token never reaches
    # the graph. Driving a real browser through install -> upgrade -> rollback and
    # counting evaluations of src/main.js gives ONE. The upgrade re-runs the shim
    # at its new ?v= URL; the shim imports './src/main.js'; that resolves to the
    # same URL; the module map returns the already-evaluated old module.
    #
    # So the token goes in the PATH: /api/plugins/<id>/g/<n>/screen.js. Every
    # relative import inherits it at every depth — for free, with no
    # import-specifier rewriting (which could never see `import(expr)` anyway).
    #
    # WHY A PATH REWRITE AND NOT TWO MIRRORED ROUTES. The token shifts the base
    # URL, so EVERYTHING a module resolves relatively moves with it — not just
    # imports. `new URL('../assets/worklet.js', import.meta.url)` from
    # /api/plugins/x/g/1/src/main.js resolves to /api/plugins/x/g/1/assets/... .
    # Mirroring only screen.js and src/ would fix imports and 404 every asset,
    # worklet and wasm file the graph reaches — and would silently break again the
    # next time someone adds a plugin route. Stripping the segment before routing
    # makes every plugin route, present and future, work under the prefix.
    #
    # The token is opaque: it is never joined into a filesystem path (and is gone
    # by the time any handler runs), so containment still rests entirely on the
    # same safe_join the un-prefixed routes use.
