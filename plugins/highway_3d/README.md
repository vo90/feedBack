# 3D Highway

A 3D note highway visualization for [FeedBack](https://github.com/got-feedback/feedBack) — an alternative to the default 2D highway, with a sense of depth and perspective inspired by stage views in modern rhythm games.

## What you get

- A camera-perspective highway with notes flying down toward a virtual fretboard at the bottom of the screen
- Glowing strings that pulse and brighten on each hit
- Note Detection feedback, including hit/miss outlines and diagnostic
  early/late/sharp/flat labels when the note detection plugin emits enriched
  judgments
- Chord frame-boxes, named-chord labels, and a chord diagram overlay (configurable corner position) so you can read shapes at a glance
- Two complementary barre indicators fire together when a barre chord shape is detected (2+ consecutive strings fretted at the lowest fret, e.g. F `[1,1,2,3,3,1]`, or an outer-edge full-span barre with every intermediate string fretted, e.g. B major `x24442`): a translucent vertical line across the strings on the 3D highway, and a straight bracket drawn inside the first fret space of the chord diagram overlay
- A heat-colored fret number row that lights up around your active playing region
- Selectable color palettes for the strings — pick the look you want
- Audio-reactive ambient background animations (particles, silhouettes, stage lights, geometric — pick one or turn it off)
- Lyrics overlay synced to the song
- Works as the main player view *or* per-panel inside the splitscreen plugin

## Install

3D Highway ships **bundled** with FeedBack — no separate installation needed. Pick **3D Highway** from the visualization picker in the player.

> **Note:** The bundled version is preferred over any user-installed copy with the same plugin ID. If you have an old `feedBack-plugin-3dhighway` clone on disk (from before 3D Highway was promoted to core), it will be ignored at startup — a warning in the server log names the path of the discarded copy. You can safely delete the stale clone.
>
> **Fallback:** In the unlikely event that the bundled copy fails to load its routes (e.g., a broken bundled release), FeedBack will automatically fall back to your user-installed copy and show a yellow "Fallback" badge in the Settings panel. Check the server startup log for the root cause in that case.

## Settings

Most of the visual controls (background style, intensity, audio reactivity, color palette) live on FeedBack's **Settings** screen under the *3D Highway* section.

### Incoming fret numbers

Gold fret numbers sit below the chord-box or note-stem base for chords, single
notes and arpeggios. They retain the same fret and timing positions. In dense
passages, overlapping nearer gems and technique symbols render over farther
numbers, including when sustain effects change a gem's drawing order.

At the play line, a number hands off to the fixed fretboard row only when the
same fret is visible there and the labels overlap. The fixed number becomes
gold; missing or offscreen row labels never hide the incoming number. The
normal camera fit guard accounts for the visible digits and Text size. If a
matching arrival digit is still partly clipped at the zoom limit, its text is
lifted just inside the screen before the handoff. Manual camera positioning
remains under your control.

### Bend starts and linked slides

An explicit bend sample at note onset sets both the approaching gem's height and
the trail's starting height. When a curve omits that sample, the renderer uses a
fallback: an ordinary bend rises from zero to its first timed target; a release
or pre-bend keeps its first value. A contiguous authored link can instead carry
the preceding note's ending bend into an ordinary continuation whose curve
omits its onset. Authored onset
samples take precedence, including zero. This fills missing visual information
without changing the chart, note detection, or whether a note must be picked.

For example, a linked slide from fret 22 to 24 followed by a delayed bend target
remains one continuous gesture with no second attack gem at fret 24. Explicit
pre-bends still approach at their bent height. Scalar-only bends retain their
existing synthesized rise/hold/release shape.

### Perf bench (`?h3dbench=1`)

Append `?h3dbench=1` to the player URL to enable opt-in `console.log` reporting of `update()` self-time, broken into six segments — `frame` (everything between `pbBeg(0)` at the top of `update()` and `pbEnd(0)` at the bottom; excludes the trailing `pbReportTick()` logging that fires after `pbEnd(0)`), `state` (per-frame state-derivation loop), `next` (next-note-by-string lookahead), `mat` (per-string material writes), `noteDraw` (single-note draw loop), `chordDraw` (chord draw loop). Reported every 5 seconds with p50 / p95 / max per segment and frame count, so before/after numbers on a target chart are reproducible (feedBack#226). Off-by-default; the bench helpers (`pbBeg` / `pbEnd` / `pbReportTick`) are bound to a shared empty-function literal when the renderer instance is created (each `createHighway()` panel re-checks the flag), so the hot-path call sites are no-ops with negligible overhead (typically JIT-inlined).
