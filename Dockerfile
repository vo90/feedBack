# ── Stage 1c: Fetch static ffmpeg ─────────────────────────────────────────
# Throwaway stage — only the ffmpeg/ffprobe binaries cross into the final
# image via COPY. Doing the download here (rather than in stage 2) means
# the final image never has to install curl, which transitively pulls in
# libcurl4t64 → librtmp1 → libgnutls30t64 (and therefore gnutls28 with
# its unfixed HIGH CVEs). Alpine is used because it's tiny and the
# download tools don't need any of Debian's TLS baggage.
#
# Source: BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds (GPL static build, 7.1 series).
# BtbN keeps only the last 14 daily builds, but retains the last build of
# each month for two years. Pin a retained month-end release and verify
# both checksums; a dated URL alone does not guarantee availability.
# Includes libvorbis for Sloppak's .ogg output path.
#
# To bump: pick a retained month-end autobuild-* tag from
#   https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases
# download the two linux gpl-7.1 tarballs, re-run
#   sha256sum ffmpeg-*-linux{64,arm64}-gpl-7.1.tar.xz
# and update FFMPEG_RELEASE + both SHA256 ARGs below.

# ── Stage 1d: Build the Tailwind stylesheet over the FULL plugin set ──────
# The committed static/tailwind.min.css is generated against only the in-tree
# plugins. Rather than ship it as-is (leaving baked-in plugins' classes
# unstyled now that the Play CDN's runtime JIT is gone — feedBack#411),
# rebuild it here, after static/ + plugins/ are present, so the sheet covers
# whatever plugins are baked into the image. Runs in a throwaway node stage so
# this build-time toolchain never lands in the final image; the runtime node
# added later in the final stage (for on-install regeneration) is a separate,
# deliberate inclusion. Reuses the repo's tailwind.config.js (theme, safelist,
# highway_3d exclusion) for parity with scripts/build-tailwind.sh.
# (Runtime-installed plugins are handled separately by the server's rebuild.)
